# Hi there üëã  

Welcome to my *source* of truth. Developers should get that one üòÅ.

I'm a Senior Engineer with over 20 years of hands-on coding experience in Java and PHP. I take pride in being a problem solver and an open-source advocate. I'm always eager to learn and share what I find.

Currently, I'm focused on building tools and workflows for web development and automation.
